How to Run:

1. Clone the repository onto your machine
2. Navigate to AVD Manager in Android Studio and create a new virtual device. Choose a device that supports the google play store
3. Set the location on your virtual device to that of your current location from the settings of the emulator. This is the location obtained by the built in GPS sensor of the emulator.
4. Press the Play button in the top right corner
5. Enjoy!!

Note: If the map feature does not work, try changing the API key to a new one in the google_maps_api.xml file in the values sub folder in res.
